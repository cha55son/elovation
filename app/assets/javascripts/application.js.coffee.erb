# CoffeeScript routing based on the data-controller & data-action attributes on the body.
# Use the following to trigger JS for a specific page:
#
# $(document).on 'turbolinks:event controller:action', ->
#     console.log 'I made it to controller:action!'
#

# page:before-change a Turbolinks-enabled link has been clicked
# page:fetch         starting to fetch a new target page
# page:receive       the page has been fetched from the server, but not yet parsed
# page:before-unload the page has been parsed and is about to be changed
# page:after-remove  a node (stored in event.data) has been removed from the DOM and should be cleaned up (jQuery data is cleaned up automatically)
# page:change        the page has been changed to the new version (and on DOMContentLoaded)
# page:update        is triggered alongside both page:change and jQuery's ajaxSuccess 
#                    (if jQuery is available - otherwise you can manually trigger it when calling XMLHttpRequest in your own code)
# page:load          is fired at the end of the loading process.
# page:restore       is fired at the end of restore process.
